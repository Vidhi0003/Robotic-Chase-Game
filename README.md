# Robotic-Chase-Game

For this project, I worked in a group to create a robotic chase game using C++ code and Arduinos. Each member of the group had to use an Arduino that works along with 2 different devices. The devices ranged from an LCD to ulltrasonic sensors to servo motors. I ended up learning a lot about coding hardware and using the Arduino IDE. We collaboarted as a group and did our best to follow a timeline which would allow us to complete the project.
